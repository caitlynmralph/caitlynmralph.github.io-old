      <description>Summer 2017 The Pudding, in conjunction with Russell Goldenberg
Pinpointed an interesting topic in pop culture, created a dataset through web scraping in Python, worked with the database in SQL, drew interesting conclusions, programmed a Markov Chain text simulator, conducted sentiment analysis on large swaths of text data, mocked up design ideas, and worked with Russell Goldenberg of The Pudding to make the graphics come to life.

      <guid>https://caitlynralph.github.io/thesis/overview/</guid>
      <description>The thesis, still being completed, is chronicling the creation of a visual essay to display the principles of data visualization, visual storytelling, and data journalism. Alongside describing the technicalities of coding a visual essay, the thesis is also addressing the state of the art for this emerging field, which combines data visualization/science and the dissemination of information to the public sphere. The essay topic gathers data on the rise of one of the UK’s biggest bands in an attempt to codify their story to success, quantitatively and visually.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Analyzing RS-fMRI Data</title>

      <guid>https://caitlynralph.github.io/datavisualization/fmri/</guid>
      <description>Summer 2016 The Mind Research Network, Albuquerque, New Mexico
 Coded a new algorithm for a more descriptive temporal analysis of fMRI images in the resting-state. The goal was to write a method that provided researchers more information than traditional analysis methods, such as Independent Component Analysis, currently tell us about neuroimages. Also programmed a way to visualize the results of this analysis algorithm as clearly and descriptively as possible. Presented findings to staff at the Mind Research Network and the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute.</description>

      <description>Summer 2015 The Mind Research Network, Albuquerque, New Mexico
 Conducted various exploratory analyses to research if diffusion based white matter imaging could be a biomarker for the neurodegenerative disease Vascular Cognitive Impairment (the second leading cause of dementia behind Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s). The goal was to analyze diffusion tensor imaging&amp;rsquo;s (DTI) fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) to find the most descriptive diffusion property in classifying subjects and the most affected brain regions in VCI patients.</description>
