      <description>Summer 2017 The Pudding
Pinpointed another interesting topic in pop culture, created a dataset through web scraping in Python, worked with the database in SQL, drew interesting conclusions, mocked up design ideas, coded a visualization in D3 with design assistance from Matt Daniels of The Pudding.

      <description>Summer 2016 The Mind Research Network, Albuquerque, New Mexico
 Coded a new algorithm for a more descriptive temporal analysis of fMRI images in the resting-state. The goal was to write a method that provided researchers more information than traditional analysis methods, such as Independent Component Analysis, currently tell us about neuroimages. Also programmed a way to visualize the results of this analysis algorithm as clearly and descriptively as possible. Presented findings to staff at the Mind Research Network and the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based White Matter Imaging in VCI</title>

      <description>Summer 2015 The Mind Research Network, Albuquerque, New Mexico
 Conducted various exploratory analyses to research if diffusion based white matter imaging could be a biomarker for the neurodegenerative disease Vascular Cognitive Impairment (the second leading cause of dementia behind Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s). The goal was to analyze diffusion tensor imaging&amp;rsquo;s (DTI) fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) to find the most descriptive diffusion property in classifying subjects and the most affected brain regions in VCI patients.</description>
